        <h1>Tic-Tac-Toe</h1>
        <h2>What is Tic-Tac-Toe?</h2>
        <p>Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-person game, played on a 3X3 board. The objective of the game is to complete a sequence of identical symbols, while at the same time blocking the opponent from doing so. Such sequence can be a row, a line or a diagonal.</p>

        <h2>How to play?</h2>
        <p>The first person to start the game can choose between <span>&#10006;</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#11096;</span>. In the example below, the first player chooses <span>&#10006;</span>.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>The first player marks any of the nine slots with <span>&#10006;</span>. <br>
                Their opponent will be assigned the
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#11096;</span> symbol.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Once the second player marks their slot, it’s the first player’s turn to mark the next free slot.</p>
                <div class="note">
                    <p>Remember! The goal is to be the first to complete a line, a row, or a diagonal of the same symbol.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Each player will mark their next slot, trying to block their opponent’s sequence and to complete their own.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>For each turn, try and see a pattern in the other player’s marked slots. Block your opponent by selecting the slot that would have helped them complete their sequence.</p>
                <ol class="sub-roman">
                    <li>
                        <p>If the other player fails to block you, mark your next slot to complete your sequence.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <ol class="sub-roman">
                    <li value="2">If the other player blocked you, select a slot that would lead to a different sequence.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The game is completed when either of the players manages to complete a sequence, or after reaching a stalemate where no sequences can be completed.</p>
